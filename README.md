## üöÄ Recommendations  

Based on the MavenMovies SQL analysis, the following recommendations can help improve business decisions and customer engagement:  

- **Customer Retention**  
  - Target customers with fewer than 15 rentals using loyalty rewards or personalized offers.  
  - Provide incentives for inactive customers to return (discount coupons, free trials).  

- **Movie Catalog Optimization**  
  - Stock more copies of the most rented and top-grossing films to meet demand.  
  - Focus on genres and ratings with higher rental trends (e.g., PG-13 or Action movies).  

- **Revenue Growth**  
  - Promote premium rental plans for movies with higher rental rates.  
  - Use promotions and bundles for low-performing movies to increase rentals.  

- **Branch Performance**  
  - Allocate more inventory to stores generating the highest revenue.  
  - Monitor availability to reduce ‚Äúout of stock‚Äù cases at popular branches.  

- **Future Strategy**  
  - Build a recommendation system using rental history and reviews to suggest movies.  
  - Deploy interactive dashboards (Tableau/Power BI) for real-time insights.
