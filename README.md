## 🗂️ Database Structure

### Core Tables

- Movies → details of films (title, description, release year, rating, rental rates, genre).

- Performers → information about actors/actresses.

- Movie_performer → links performers with movies (and their roles).

- Members → registered customers (with contact info, phone, DOB).

- Branches → rental store branches.

- Employees → staff working at branches.

- Inventory → copies of each movie available (status: AVAILABLE / RENTED / DAMAGED).

- Rentals → rental transactions (rental/return dates, linked to members & employees).

- Transactions → payment records for rentals.

## 📊 Use Cases

- SQL Training Project (Joins, Group By, Aggregations, CASE statements)

- Business Analysis (revenue, top movies, customer loyalty)
